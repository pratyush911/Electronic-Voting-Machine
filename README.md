# Electronic-Voting-Machine
The Indian democracy is the biggest client of the electronic voting system.
So much so, that no country even close to it in terms of population and
size, has been able to successfully implement the use of Electronic Voting Machines
(EVMs) for election purposes. Even in India, EVMs have been mired
in controversies. With different parties accusing the EVMs of being rigged
or incompetent to support the elections of the worldâ€™s largest democracy, this
paper aims to understand the social and political requirements of an EVM
design, and then work out a formal specification of an EVM design based on
the requirements.
